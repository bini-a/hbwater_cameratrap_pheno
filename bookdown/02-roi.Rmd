# Selecting Region of Interest

This chapter provides an overview about the Python scripts used to create a polygonal region of interest and mask for images contained in folders. 

A region of interest is often needed to eliminate irrelevant regions or sections of the image. In our case, we wanted to focus solely on stream water/ice rather than surrounding rocks or shrubbery (these could interfere with the machine learning step later).

Before beginning this section, ensure that all image files are properly named.

`interactive_ROI_app.py` is the script used to create a region of interest and mask for images within a folder. Below is a visual aid concept map that outlines the steps within this process.

```{r roi-concept-map, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/ROI concept map.png")
```


## Using the Script

This section will explain the necessary elements and steps for you to follow while
using this script. For more information about how the script works, see **Section 3.2**; for more information about the functions within the script, see **Section 3.3**.


### Import Packages

Before running the script, load in all necessary packages. While testing our script, we have found that the "`Qt5Agg`" backend works best for Windows system while the "`MacOSX`" backend works best for Apple. These backends allow us to work interactively with the python plotting library `matplotlib`. For more information, visit `matplotlib`'s official website.[^2]

During testing of the script, we found *PyCharm* to be the best IDE for running the script, because *vscode* didn't support interactivity through `matplotlib`. Thus, we recommend using *PyCharm* to run this program.


```{python load-python-packages2, eval = FALSE}
import re
import matplotlib as mpl
import os.path
import pandas as pd
from PIL import Image

mpl.use('Qt5Agg')  # backend
import cv2
from roipoly import RoiPoly
import glob2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.widgets import Button
from collections import OrderedDict
from matplotlib.path import Path as MplPath
```


### Set Folder Path

Our script denotes the file path to a folder and stores it in a variable `folder_path`. Change the example path to the path of the folder for which to operate on. We then use the `.glob` function of the `glob` package to store the file path for each image into the variable `image_folder`.

```{python load-image-folder, eval = FALSE}
folder_path = r"\Example\Path\To\Folder"
image_folder = glob2.glob(folder_path + "/*")
```


### Drawing ROIs

After setting the folder path, **run** the script to open a popup window -- this is the `matplotlib` interactive interface. It should display the first image in `image_folder` and give you the option to select an ROI. 

```{r image-mid-creation, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/mid_creation_first_roi.png")
```

In the `matplotlib` interactive interface, a point is drawn by left-clicking. By left-clicking again, a new point is created and the line becomes static. A new line is again shown from the last point to the user cursor. 

To complete a figure, the user right- or double-clicks, bounding the last selected point to the first. The polygon created within the image is the region of interest (ROI).

Once you have finished drawing your ROI, click the `Confirm` button to apply the ROI and mask to all remaining images in the folder.

```{r image-confirm-button, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/confirmbutton.png")

```

After the mask has been applied, you can view the mask overlaid on all the remaining images (or prior images) by clicking the `Previous` or `Next` buttons.

```{r image-previous-next-button, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/previousnext.jpg")

```

In some cases, the original ROI may no longer fit the new image - this is often the case if, for instance, snow melts and the water levels of the river rise. In such cases, redrawing the ROI may be necessary. To do this, click the `Restart masking` button, which should again bring up the interactive interface and allow you to redraw and confirm an ROI.

```{r image-restart-masking, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/restartmasking.png")

```

Once you are satisfied with your new ROI, click the `Confirm` button to apply the new mask to the remainder of the images in the folder, and keep scrolling with the `Previous` and `Next` buttons. Then, click `Finish masking` when you are done.

```{r image-finish-button, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/finishmasking.jpg")

```

This will close the ROI window and generate data frames containing information about the masked images, as well as a folder containing the masked images.

### Output

After you are done drawing ROIs, the script will generate three seperate outputs automatically. See the photos below for examples.

The first is a wateryear folder containing masked images.

```{r wateryear-folder, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/wateryear_example_folder.png")

```

The second is a dataframe that stores each `mask_id` to its associated mask.

```{r Dataframe-id-mask, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/maskid_mask.png")

```

Finally, the script will generate a dataframe that stores each `mask_id` to its associated date.

```{r Dataframe-date-id, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/date_mask_csv_example.png")

```



## RoiPoly Functionalities

`RoiPoly`[^1] is the python module from which our mouse click events are handled. The functions within this script allow the user to create an ROI by drawing a polygon with mouse clicks. The following section will provide a descriptive overview of the script and its functions.

### ImageFile Class

The script contains a class named `ImageFile`. Objects in this class have information
from a file along a specific filepath as their attributes. 

```{python image_file_lass, eval = FALSE}
class ImageFile:
    """ Image File class to save file path, file name, date, mask_id"""

    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.path = filename
        self.image_name = filename.split("\\")[-1]
        self.date = self.get_date()
        self.mm, self.dd, self.yy = self.date.split("/")
        self.mask_id = None
        
```

There is an `ImageFile` object for each image in the folder `image_folder`. Within this class are functions that extract the time stamp and an array of RGB values for each image. Additionally, the water year for each image is derived from its timestamp, as is a sliced-array version of each image for faster plotting. These objects are appended to image_file_list, which is then sorted by water years.

A list with complete information of every file in image_folder is appended to `image_file_list`, which is then sorted and converted to a list of arrays for plotting purposes.

```{python sort-image-folder, eval = FALSE}
image_file_list = []
for filename in image_folder:
    filetype = filename[-4:]
    # Check if the file name ends with ".JPG" or ".jpg"
    if filetype.lower() != ".jpg":
        continue
    curr_IF = ImageFile(filename)
    image_file_list.append(curr_IF)

# sort by year, then month, then day
image_file_list = np.array(sorted(image_file_list, key=lambda x: (x.yy, x.mm, x.dd)))

```


### First ROI and Masking Function

Upon running the script, a popup window will open displaying the first image in `image_folder`. The user can then select a polygonal ROI and apply a mask. 

Each selected point in a created polygon is stored into `poly_verts` (short for polygon vertices), which is used to create the mask outline for the region of interest.

```{python get_mask, eval = FALSE}
def get_mask_poly_verts(image, poly_verts, on_original=False):
    if len(np.shape(image)) == 3:
        ny, nx, nz = np.shape(image)
    else:
        ny, nx = np.shape(image)
    # if mask is applied to original, each coordinate is multiplied by 2
    if on_original:
        poly_verts = [(2 * x, 2 * y) for (x, y) in poly_verts]

    x, y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(nx), np.arange(ny))
    x, y = x.flatten(), y.flatten()
    points = np.vstack((x, y)).T
    roi_path = MplPath(poly_verts)
    mask = roi_path.contains_points(points).reshape((ny, nx))
    return mask
```


After creating a region of interest, the user must click the `Confirm` button to proceed and apply the mask. These buttons are part of `matplotlib`'s `Button` module.

Creating one requires an event function, as well as button initialization as seen below for the `Confirm` button. The `confirm_roi` event is triggered when the button is clicked.

```{python initalizing_button, eval = FALSE}
confirm_ax = plt.axes([0.81, 0.05, 0.1, 0.075])
confirm_button = Button(confirm_ax, 'Confirm')
confirm_button.on_clicked(confirm_roi)
confirm_button._button = confirm_button
```

```{python confirm-button, eval = FALSE}
def confirm_roi(event):
    """
    Callback event for confirm button
    If users select ROI and hit confirm, save the poly_verts and apply it to the rest of images
    Then, start showing next and previous buttons
    """

    # save current mask's poly_verts starting from start_img_ind index
    for i in range(start_img_ind, len(image_file_list)):
        poly_verts_list[i] = curr_poly_verts

    img_display_axis.set_title("Choose next or redraw ROI for {}".format(image_file_list[start_img_ind].date))
    # button to show next and prev masked images
    _ = show_next_prev()

```

We use Boolean algebra to apply the mask onto the image, rendering everything outside of the ROI black.

After the ROI is confirmed and mask is applied, users can click the `Previous` and `Next` buttons to view subsequent/prior images in the folder with the mask applied. 

These are part of the callback function `Callback`, which makes sliding through a folder possible through indexing. By indexing, each image is drawn with its associated date in the figure title.

```{python next_prev_buttons, eval = FALSE}
def next(self, event):
    """
    :param event: event callback for matplotlib button
    Slide to the next image in folder and display it
    """
    self.index += 1
    if not self.index_in_range():
        print("Reached End of Folder")
        self.index -= 1
        return
    im = self.get_masked_img()
    img_display.set_data(im)
    img_display_axis.set_title("Click next or draw new ROI for Date: {}".format(image_file_list[self.index].get_date()))
    plt.draw()

def prev(self, event):
    """
    :param event: event callback for matplotlib button
    Slide to the previous image in folder and display it
    """
    self.index -= 1
    if not self.index_in_range():
        print("Reached Start of Folder")
        self.index += 1
        return

    im = self.get_masked_img()
    img_display.set_data(im)
    img_display_axis.set_title("Click next or draw new ROI for Date: {}".format(image_file_list[self.index].get_date()))
    plt.draw()
```


To redraw the ROI and apply it to the remaining images, the user must click the `Restart masking` button. The user can then create a new region of interest and click `Confirm` to proceed to apply the new mask. After creating a new ROI, the user has the option to either confirm or to redraw the ROI again.

The underlying dynamics of the `restart_masking` button can be seen here.

```{python restart-masking-button, eval = FALSE}
def restart_masking(event):
    """
    :param event: Callback event when user restarts masking
    Clears plot and begin a new ROI masking session
    """
    global my_roi, confirm_button, restart_masking_button, img_display, img_display_axis, start_img_ind, curr_mask, curr_poly_verts

    # clear plot
    plt.clf()
    # create new plot
    fg_2 = plt.gcf()
    fg_2.subplots_adjust(left=0.3, bottom=0.25)
    fg_2.set_size_inches(w, h, forward=True)

    # change the content of image on curr axis
    img_display_axis = plt.gca()
    if not callback.index_in_range():
        print("OUT OF RANGE")
        return
    curr_ind = callback.index
    curr_obj = image_file_list[curr_ind]
    img_display_axis.set_title("Confirm ROI? Date: {}".format(curr_obj.get_date()))
    img_display = img_display_axis.imshow(curr_obj.read_img_sliced())
    # display new ROI pop up
    my_roi = RoiPoly(color='r', close_fig=False)

    # wait until the user finishes selecting ROI
    while not my_roi.finished_clicking:
        plt.pause(0.01)

    # mask current image and display
    cp = curr_obj.read_img_sliced().copy()
    curr_mask, curr_poly_verts = my_roi.get_mask(cp)
    cp = apply_mask(cp, curr_mask)
    start_img_ind = curr_ind
    img_display = img_display_axis.imshow(cp)

    # Create a confirm mask button for new session
    confirm_ax = plt.axes([0.81, 0.05, 0.1, 0.075])
    confirm_button = Button(confirm_ax, 'Confirm')
    confirm_button.on_clicked(confirm_roi)
    confirm_button._button = confirm_button

    # Create a restart mask button for new session
    restart_masking_ax = plt.axes([0.1, 0.05, 0.3, 0.075])
    restart_masking_button = Button(restart_masking_ax, "Restart masking")
    restart_masking_button.on_clicked(restart_masking)

    plt.draw()

```

Once masking has been complete, click the `Finish masking` button to close the figure. This button event also generates the output of the script. This event is slow and hefty, expect a long processing time.

```{python finsh_masking, eval = FALSE}
def finish_masking(event):
    """
        :param event: Callback event for finish masking button
        save dataframe linking mask_id to actual mask  (mask_df)
        create water year folders
        save dataframe linking date to mask_id (date_mask_df)
        apply masks on original images and save them in their respective water year folders
        close plot
    """
    global poly_verts_list

    # collect unique poly_verts and assign mask_ids to them
    poly_verts_unique_list = []
    mask_id = -1
    for i in range(len(poly_verts_list)):
        if mask_id == -1 or poly_verts_list[i - 1] != poly_verts_list[i]:
            mask_id += 1
            poly_verts_unique_list.append(poly_verts_list[i])
        # assign mask_ids to all ImageFile objects
